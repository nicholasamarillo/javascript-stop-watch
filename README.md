# Javascript Stop Watch

## What was the purpose of this project?
For me, this is the beginning to reteaching myself web developement for a career change. This project was built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I was roaming around the internet so I can find some easy, beginner projeccts to get some knowledge under my belt. I was having trouble with getting the code to run every second once the start button was clicked. I found the `setInterval` method and it definitely was the solution to my problem.
